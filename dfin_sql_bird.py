Q: Which year has the least number of movies that was released and what is the title of the movie in that year that has the highest number of rating score of 1?
Hint: least number of movies refers to MIN(movie_release_year); highest rating score refers to MAX(SUM(movie_id) where rating_score = '1')
A: Let’s think step by step. In the question , we are asked:
"Which year" so we need column = [movies.movie_release_year]
"number of movies" so we need column = [movies.movie_id]
"title of the movie" so we need column = [movies.movie_title]
"rating score" so we need column = [ratings.rating_score]
Hint also refers to the columns = [movies.movie_release_year, movies.movie_id, ratings.rating_score]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [movies.movie_id = ratings.movie_id].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [1]. So the Schema_links are:
Schema_links: [movies.movie_release_year, movies.movie_title, ratings.rating_score, movies.movie_id=ratings.movie_id, 1]

Q: What is the list ID that was first created by user 85981819?
Hint: first created list refers to oldest list_creation_date_utc;
schema_links: [lists_users.list_id, lists_users.user_id, lists_user.list_creation_date_utc, 85981819]
A: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the given question needs these tables = [lists_users], so we don't need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't require nested queries, and we need the answer to the sub-questions = [""].
So, we don't need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".
Label: "EASY"

Q: How many more movie lists were created by the user who created the movie list \"250 Favourite Films\"?
Hint: 250 Favourite Films refers to list_title;
schema_links: [lists_users.list_id,lists_users.user_id,lists.user_id,lists.list_title,250 Favourite Films]
A: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the given question needs these tables = [lists,lists_users], so we need JOIN.
Plus, it requires nested queries, and we need the answer to the sub-questions = [who created the movie list \"250 Favourite Films\"?].
So, we need JOIN and need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as "NESTED".
Label: "NESTED"

Q: What is the percentage of the ratings were rated by user who was a subcriber?
Hint: user is a subscriber refers to user_subscriber = 1; percentage of ratings = DIVIDE(SUM(user_subscriber = 1), SUM(rating_score)) as percent;
schema_links: [ratings.user_subscriber,1]
A: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the given question needs these tables = [ratings], so we don't need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't require nested queries, and we need the answer to the sub-questions = [""].
So, we don't need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as "EASY".

Q: Was the user who created the \"World War 2 and Kids\" list eligible for trial when he created the list? Indicate how many followers does the said list has.
Hint: user was eligible for trial when he created the list refers to user_eligible_for_trial = 1; number of followers a list have refers to list_followers;
schema_links: [lists_users.user_eligible_for_trial, lists.list_followers, lists.list_title, lists.user_id = lists_user.user_id,lists.list_id = lists_user.list_id, World War 2 and Kids]
A: Let’s think step by step. The SQL query for the given question needs these tables = [lists, lists_users], so we need JOIN.
Plus, it doesn't need nested queries, and we need the answer to the sub-questions = [""].
So, we need JOIN and don't need nested queries, then the SQL query can be classified as "NON-NESTED".

Q: What is the average rating for movie titled 'When Will I Be Loved'?
Hint: average rating = DIVIDE((SUM(rating_score where movie_title = 'When Will I Be Loved')), COUNT(rating_score));
Schema_links: [ratings.rating_score, movies.movie_title, movies.movie_id = ratings.movie_id, When Will I Be Loved]
A: Let’s think step by step. For creating the SQL for the given question, we need to join these tables = [ratings,movies].
First of all, for joining these tables we have to use the common column = [ratings.movie_id = movies.movie_id].
Now, we have to filter the rows where movie_title = 'When Will I Be Loved'.
Then, we have to find the average of the rating_score.
So the sqlite SQL query will be:
SQL: SELECT AVG(T2.rating_score) FROM movies AS T1 INNER JOIN ratings AS T2 ON T1.movie_id = T2.movie_id WHERE T1.movie_title = 'When Will I Be Loved'

Q: For movie titled 'Welcome to the Dollhouse', how many percentage of the ratings were rated with highest score.
Hint: rated with highest score refers to rating_score = 5; percentage = MULTIPLY(DIVIDE(SUM(rating_score = 5), COUNT(rating_score)), 100)
Schema_links: [ratings.rating_score, movies.movie_title, movies.movie_id = ratings.movie_id, Welcome to the Dollhouse]
A: Let’s think step by step. For creating the SQL for the given question, we need to join these tables = [ratings,movies].
First of all, for joining these tables we have to use the common column = [ratings.movie_id = movies.movie_id].
Now, we have to filter the rows where movie_title = 'Welcome to the Dollhouse'.
Then, we have to find the percentage of the ratings were rated with highest score which is 5.
So the sqlite SQL query will be:
SQL: SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T2.rating_score = 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(*) FROM movies AS T1 INNER JOIN ratings AS T2 ON T1.movie_id = T2.movie_id WHERE T1.movie_title = 'Welcome to the Dollhouse'

Q: For all ratings which are rated in year 2020, name the movies which has the rating scored 4 and above.
Hint: ratings in year 2020 refers to rating_timestamp_utc like '%2020%'; rating_score > = 4;
Schema_links: [ratings.rating_timestamp_utc, movies.movie_title, movies.movie_id = ratings.movie_id, 2020, 4]
A: Let’s think step by step. For creating the SQL for the given question, we need to join these tables = [ratings,movies].
First of all, for joining these tables we have to use the common column = [ratings.movie_id = movies.movie_id].
Now, we have to filter the rows where rating_timestamp_utc like '%2020%' and rating_score > = 4.
Then, we have to find the movie_title.
So the sqlite SQL query will be:
SQL: SELECT T2.movie_title FROM ratings AS T1 INNER JOIN movies AS T2 ON T1.movie_id = T2.movie_id WHERE CAST(SUBSTR(T1.rating_timestamp_utc, 1, 4) AS INTEGER) = 2020 AND CAST(SUBSTR(T1.rating_timestamp_utc, 6, 2) AS INTEGER) > 4

Q: What is the average score of the movie \"The Fall of Berlin\" in 2019?
Hint: The Fall of Berlin' is movie_title; in 2019 refers to rating_timestamp_utc = 2019; Average score refers to Avg(rating_score);
Schema_links: [ratings.rating_score, ratings.rating_id, movies.movie_title, T1.rating_timestamp_utc, movies.movie_id = ratings.movie_id, The Fall of Berlin, 2019]
A: Let’s think step by step. For creating the SQL for the given question, we need to join these tables = [ratings,movies].
First of all, for joining these tables we have to use the common column = [ratings.movie_id = movies.movie_id].
Now, we have to filter the rows where movie_title = 'The Fall of Berlin' and rating_timestamp_utc = 2019.
Then, we have to find the average of the rating_score which can be computed by dividing the sum of rating_score by the count of rating_id.
So the sqlite SQL query will be:
SQL: SELECT SUM(T1.rating_score) / COUNT(T1.rating_id) FROM ratings AS T1 INNER JOIN movies AS T2 ON T1.movie_id = T2.movie_id WHERE T1.rating_timestamp_utc LIKE '2019%' AND T2.movie_title LIKE 'The Fall of Berlin'

Q: How many more movie lists were created by the user who created the movie list \"250 Favourite Films\"?
Hint: 250 Favourite Films refers to list_title;
Schema_links: [lists_users.list_id, lists_users.user_id = lists.user_id, lists.list_title, 250 Favourite Films]
A: Let's think step by step. the given question can be solved by knowing the answer to the following sub-questions = [which user has created the movie list \"250 Favourite Films\".]
The sqlite SQL query for the sub-question "which user has created the movie list \"250 Favourite Films\"" is SELECT user_id FROM lists WHERE list_title = '250 Favourite Films'
The above query will return the user_id of the user who has created the movie list \"250 Favourite Films\".
Now, we have to find the number of movie lists created by the user who has created the movie list \"250 Favourite Films\".
So, the final sqlite SQL query answer to the question the given question is =
SQL: SELECT COUNT(list_id) FROM lists_users WHERE user_id = ( SELECT user_id FROM lists WHERE list_title = '250 Favourite Films' )

Q: For the user who post the list that contained the most number of the movies, is he/she a paying subscriber when creating that list?
Hint: the list that contained the most number of the movies refers to MAX(list_movie_number); user_has_payment_method = 1 means the user was a paying subscriber when he created the list ; \nuser_has_payment_method = 0 means the user was not a paying subscriber when he created the list
Schema_links: [lists_users.user_has_payment_method, lists_users.list_id = lists.list_id, lists.list_movie_number, lists.list_movie_number]
A: Let's think step by step. the given question can be solved by knowing the answer to the following sub-questions = [which list has the most number of movies.]
The sqlite SQL query for the sub-question "which list has the most number of movies" is SELECT MAX(list_movie_number) FROM lists
The above query will return the list_movie_number of the list which has the most number of movies.
Now, we have to find the user_has_payment_method of the user who has created the list which has the most number of movies.
To do so, we have to JOIN lists_users and lists table on list_id.
So, the final sqlite SQL query answer to the question the given question is =
SQL: SELECT T1.user_has_payment_method FROM lists_users AS T1 INNER JOIN lists AS T2 ON T1.list_id = T2.list_id WHERE T2.list_movie_number = ( SELECT MAX(list_movie_number) FROM lists )

Q: Which year was the third movie directed by Quentin Tarantino released? Indicate the user ids of the user who gave it a rating score of 4.
Hint: third movie refers to third movie that has oldest movie_release_year;
Schema_links: [movies.movie_release_year,ratings.user_id,ratings.rating_score,movies.movie_id = ratings.movie_id, movies.director_name, Quentin Tarantino, 4]
A: Let's think step by step. the given question can be solved by knowing the answer to the following sub-questions = [What is the third movie directed by Quentin Tarantino.]
The sqlite SQL query for the sub-question "what is third movie directed by Quentin Tarantino" is SELECT movie_id FROM movies WHERE director_name = 'Quentin Tarantino' ORDER BY movie_release_year ASC LIMIT 2, 1 
The above query will return the movie_id of the third movie directed by Quentin Tarantino.
Now, we have to find the year in which the third movie directed by Quentin Tarantino was released.
For that, we have to join the tables = [movies,ratings].
First of all, for joining these tables we have to use the common column = [movies.movie_id = ratings.movie_id].
Then, we have to filter the rows where movie_id = ( SELECT movie_id FROM movies WHERE director_name = 'Quentin Tarantino' ORDER BY movie_release_year ASC LIMIT 2, 1 ).
Then, we have to find the movie_release_year.
So, the final sqlite SQL query answer to the question the given question is =
SQL: SELECT T2.movie_release_year, T1.user_id FROM ratings AS T1 INNER JOIN movies AS T2 ON T1.movie_id = T2.movie_id WHERE T1.movie_id = ( SELECT movie_id FROM movies WHERE director_name = 'Quentin Tarantino' ORDER BY movie_release_year ASC LIMIT 2, 1 ) AND T1.rating_score = 4

Use the following instructions for fixing the sqlite SQL query:
1) Avoid redundant columns in SELECT clause, all of the columns should be mentioned in the question.
2) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the JOIN by checking the Foreign keys.
3) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the WHERE statement.
4) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the GROUP BY statement.
5) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the ORDER BY statement.
6) check that all of the columns exist in the table and there are no typos.
7) Use CAST when is needed.
8) USE CASE WHEN is needed.

Q: Name movie titles released in year 1945. Sort the listing by the descending order of movie popularity.
Hint: released in the year 1945 refers to movie_release_year = 1945;
SQL: SELECT movie_title, movie_popularity FROM movies WHERE movie_release_year = 1945/01/01 ORDER BY movie_popularity DESC LIMIT 1
A: Let's think step by step to find the correct answer.
1) The column movie_popularity is not mentioned in the question so it's redundant.
2) JOIN is not required as there is no need to join any tables.
3) The condition movie_release_year = 1945/01/01 is not correct. The correct condition is movie_release_year = 1945.
4) GROUP BY is not required as there is no need to group any columns.
5) The ORDER BY clause is correct.
6) all columns are correct and there are no typo errors.
7) CAST is not required as there is no need to cast any columns.
8) CASE is not required as there is no need to use CASE.
So, the final sqlite SQL query answer to the question the given question is =
Revised_SQL: SELECT movie_title FROM movies WHERE movie_release_year = 1945 ORDER BY movie_popularity DESC LIMIT 1
"""  # noqa: E501
HUMAN_SELF_CORRECTION_PROMPT = """
Evaluate the correctness of this query for the given question.
Hint helps you to write the correct SQL query.
Correct it if there are any issues. If there are no issues, return the SQLite SQL QUERY as is.
